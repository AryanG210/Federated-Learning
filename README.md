# Federated Learning with MNIST and CIFAR-10

This project demonstrates federated learning applied to the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Federated learning is a machine learning approach where multiple parties collaboratively train a model without sharing their data with each other. In this project, we use the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets to illustrate federated learning techniques.

## Overview

- **TensorFlow Utilization**: This project extensively utilizes TensorFlow for implementing federated learning. TensorFlow's powerful capabilities are harnessed for crafting complex neural network architectures, optimizing algorithms, and streamlining data preprocessing workflows.
  
- **Approach**: The initial step involved in this project is constructing the foundational architecture for federated learning across multiple client nodes. Rigorous evaluation is conducted on both independent and non-independent identically distributed (iid) datasets to gauge efficacy.
  
- **Improvement Strategies**: To enhance model accuracy, two key strategies are pursued. Firstly, a warm-up training phase is implemented to stabilize model convergence. Secondly, facilitation of knowledge sharing among clients is achieved by distributing a curated set of iid datasets. These interventions significantly bolster the overall accuracy and robustness of the models.
