# Federated Learning with MNIST and CIFAR-10

This project demonstrates federated learning applied to the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Federated learning is a machine learning approach where multiple parties collaboratively train a model without sharing their data with each other. In this project, we use the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets to illustrate federated learning techniques.
